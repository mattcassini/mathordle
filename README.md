# Vue Wordle

[Live demo](http://octowordle.com)

A Vue implementation of the [Wordle game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). This is just for fun and doesn't aim to 100% replicate the original.

This is a modified version of the game vue-wordle with a a math word dictionary allowing variable word lengths in a range of 4 and 14. Forked from https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-wordle.
